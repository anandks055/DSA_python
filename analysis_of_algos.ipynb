    "What is Algorithm Analysis?\n",
    "Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the time and space resources required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It helps us predict how an algorithm will perform without actually running it on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?\n",
    "Predict Behavior: It helps predict how an algorithm will perform under different conditions.\n",
    "Compare Algorithms: It allows us to compare different algorithms to choose the most efficient one.\n",
    "Save Time and Resources: Instead of implementing and testing every algorithm, analysis gives us a theoretical estimate of efficiency.\n",
    "Optimize Performance: By analyzing algorithms, we can identify bottlenecks and improve performance.\n",
    "Key Factors in Algorithm Analysis\n",
    "When analyzing algorithms, we focus on two main resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: How much time does the algorithm take to run?\n",
    "Space Complexity: How much memory does the algorithm use?\n",
    "Example: Sum of Natural Numbers\n",
    "Let’s analyze three different algorithms to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 1: Mathematical Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "function sum(n) {\n",
    "    return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "Explanation: This uses a mathematical formula to calculate the sum in constant time.\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(1) – It takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.\n",
    "Method 2: Single Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "function sum(n) {\n",
    "    let total = 0;\n",
    "    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n",
    "        total += i;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return total;\n",
    "}\n",
    "Explanation: This uses a single loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n and adds them to the total.\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(n) – The time taken grows linearly with the input size.\n",
    "Method 3: Nested Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "function sum(n) {\n",
    "    let total = 0;\n",
    "    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "    return total;\n",

    "Time Complexity: O(n²) – The time taken grows quadratically with the input size.\n",
    "Factors Affecting Time Efficiency\n",
    "Input Size (n): Larger inputs generally take more time to process.\n",
    "Hardware: A supercomputer will run the same algorithm faster than a slow computer.\n",
    "Programming Language: Some languages are faster than others (e.g., C++ is faster than JavaScript).\n",
    "Algorithm Design: The way an algorithm is designed (e.g., using loops, recursion) affects its efficiency.\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "Algorithm Analysis helps us predict and compare the efficiency of algorithms.\n",
    "Time Complexity is a measure of how fast an algorithm runs.\n",

    "Introduction to Asymptotic Notation\n",
    "The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms that don’t depend on machine-specific constants and don’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared. Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly three asymptotic notations:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O Notation (O-notation)\n",
    "Omega Notation (Ω-notation)\n",
    "Theta Notation (Θ-notation)\n",
    "1. Theta Notation (Θ-Notation):\n",
    "Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Θ(g), if there are constants c1, c2 > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c1* g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Representation of Theta notation:\n",
    "Θ (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such that 0 ≤ c1 * g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Θ(g) is a set\n",
    "\n",
    "The above expression can be described as if f(n) is theta of g(n), then the value f(n) is always between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n) for large values of n (n ≥ n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution time serves as both a lower and upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "It exist as both, most, and least boundaries for a given input value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to get the Theta notation of an expression is to drop low-order terms and ignore leading constants. For example, Consider the expression 3n3 + 6n2 + 6000 = Θ(n3), the dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a number(n) after which Θ(n3) has higher values than Θ(n2) irrespective of the constants involved. For a given function g(n), we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions. Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "{ 100 , log (2000) , 10^4 } belongs to Θ(1)\n",
    "{ (n/4) , (2n+3) , (n/100 + log(n)) } belongs to Θ(n)\n",
    "{ (n^2+n) , (2n^2) , (n^2+log(n))} belongs to Θ( n2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Θ provides exact bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Big-O Notation (O-notation):\n",
    "Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Therefore, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "If f(n) describes the running time of an algorithm, f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist a positive constant C and n0 such that, 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns the highest possible output value (big-O)for a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution time serves as an upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "BigO\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Consider the case of Insertion sort. It takes linear time in the best case and quadratic time in the worst case. We can safely say that the time complexity of the Insertion sort is O(n2). \n",
    "Note: O(n2) also covers linear time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use Θ notation to represent the time complexity of Insertion sort, we have to use two statements for best and worst cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "The worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n2).\n",
    "The best case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n). \n",
    "The Big-O notation is useful when we only have an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm. Many times we easily find an upper bound by simply looking at the algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    " Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "{ 100 , log (2000) , 10^4 } belongs to O(1)\n",
    "U { (n/4) , (2n+3) , (n/100 + log(n)) } belongs to O(n)\n",
    "U { (n^2+n) , (2n^2) , (n^2+log(n))} belongs to O( n^2) \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Here, U represents union, we can write it in these manner because O provides exact or upper bounds .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Omega Notation (Ω-Notation):\n",
    "Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution time serves as a both lower bound on the algorithm’s time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined as the condition that allows an algorithm to complete statement execution in the shortest amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Ω(g), if there is a constant c > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c*g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0\n",
    "\n",
    "BigOmega\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Representation of Omega notation :\n",
    "Ω(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0 }\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the same Insertion sort example here. The time complexity of Insertion Sort can be written as Ω(n), but it is not very useful information about insertion sort, as we are generally interested in worst-case and sometimes in the average case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "{ (n^2+n) , (2n^2) , (n^2+log(n))} belongs to Ω( n^2)\n",
    "U { (n/4) , (2n+3) , (n/100 + log(n)) } belongs to Ω(n)\n",
    "U { 100 , log (2000) , 10^4 } belongs to Ω(1)\n",
