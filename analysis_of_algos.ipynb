    "What is Algorithm Analysis?\n",
    "Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the time and space resources required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It helps us predict how an algorithm will perform without actually running it on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?\n",
    "Predict Behavior: It helps predict how an algorithm will perform under different conditions.\n",
    "Compare Algorithms: It allows us to compare different algorithms to choose the most efficient one.\n",

    "Introduction to Asymptotic Notation\n",
    "The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms that don’t depend on machine-specific constants and don’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared. Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly three asymptotic notations:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O Notation (O-notation)\n",
    "Omega Notation (Ω-notation)\n",
    "Theta Notation (Θ-notation)\n",
    "1. Theta Notation (Θ-Notation):\n",
    "Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let g and f be the function from the set of natural numbers to itself. The function f is said to be Θ(g), if there are constants c1, c2 > 0 and a natural number n0 such that c1* g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Representation of Theta notation:\n",
    "Θ (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such that 0 ≤ c1 * g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2 * g(n) for all n ≥ n0}\n",

    "The above expression can be described as if f(n) is theta of g(n), then the value f(n) is always between c1 * g(n) and c2 * g(n) for large values of n (n ≥ n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution time serves as both a lower and upper bound on the algorithm’s time complexity. \n",

    "It exist as both, most, and least boundaries for a given input value.\n",

    "A simple way to get the Theta notation of an expression is to drop low-order terms and ignore leading constants. For example, Consider the expression 3n3 + 6n2 + 6000 = Θ(n3), the dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a number(n) after which Θ(n3) has higher values than Θ(n2) irrespective of the constants involved. For a given function g(n), we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions. Examples :\n",

    "2. Big-O Notation (O-notation):\n",
    "Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Therefore, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "If f(n) describes the running time of an algorithm, f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist a positive constant C and n0 such that, 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0\n",

    "The worst-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n2).\n",
    "The best case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n). \n",
